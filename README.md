# Technical University of Crete - PLH311 - Assignment

This is an assignment I completed as an undergraduate student in a team of 2 members.

In the ".zip" file you will find my team's implementation of 3 shortest path search algorithms under uncertainty.

1) <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/article/view/18191/17982" target="_blank">Uniform Cost Search</a>
2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_A*" target="_blank">Iterative Deepening A*</a>
3) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.4076.pdf" target="_blank">Learning Real Time A*</a>

You can compile my program by executing the command "g++ project1.cpp -o project1" from a terminal.

Note:
- I've noticed a strange bug where my program works in my Windows machine but not in Ubuntu.
- I will work on it if I find the time, it's not of great importance since it's a simple project.
- If you are able to fix this bug feel free to contact me at "diamantispapadam@gmail.com".
